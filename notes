LVM : Creates a flexible storage layer so disks can be resized live without reinstalling the OS
VG : A storage pool made from physical disks.
LV : The actual “disk” your OS uses (acts like a partition).
Filesystem resize : After LV grows, filesystem still thinks old size. resize2fs makes the OS see the new space.


VM disk ≠ usable disk.
Ubuntu Server networking = Netplan, not dhclient.
Elasticsearch 8 = HTTPS + auth by default.
in case of errors always check logs

gnupg: Used to verify software authenticity.
-Xms1g: Initial JVM heap size = 1 GB.
-Xmx1g: Maximum JVM heap size = 1 GB.

JVM heap size = the amount of RAM reserved for Java applications to store objects and data.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Runtime environment that executes Elasticsearch.

cluster.initial_master_nodes: Used ONLY for multi-node clusters to elect first master.

Elasticsearch: Stores + indexes logs (the DB)
Logstash: Parses raw logs into structured fields. (raw log → source.ip, username, url) (the transformer)
Kibana: Dashboards + searches + alerts + detection rules.
Filebeat: Lightweight agent on victim machine.Ships logs to Logstash/Elasticsearch. (the collector)
